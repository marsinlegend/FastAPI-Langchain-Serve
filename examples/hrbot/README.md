# HR Slack Bot


### ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Install langchain-serve

Let's start by installing langchain-serve if you haven't already

```bash
pip install langchain-serve
```

To get this example code on your local, you can clone this repo and navigate to the `examples/hrbot` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve.git
cd langchain-serve/examples/hrbot
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 2: Create the app manifest

Slack apps can be created from scratch or, from a manifest. You can copy the following manifest and use it to create your app.
```yaml
display_information:
  name: langchain-hrbot
  background_color: "#25272e"
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: langchain-hrbot
    always_online: true
  slash_commands:
    - command: /refresh-gdrive-index
      url: https://your-app.wolf.jina.ai/slack/events
      description: Refresh GDrive Index
      should_escape: false
    - command: /remove-gdrive-index
      url: https://your-app.wolf.jina.ai/slack/events
      description: Remove GDrive index from workspace
      should_escape: false
oauth_config:
  redirect_urls:
    - https://cloud.jina.ai/
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:history
      - chat:write
      - groups:history
      - groups:read
      - im:history
      - im:read
      - im:write
      - users.profile:read
      - channels:read
      - commands
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    request_url: https://your-app.wolf.jina.ai/slack/events
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.im
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
                                                              
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 3: Create the app and configure it

- Go to [slack apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) page.
- Choose `From an app manifest` and pick the workspace you want to install the app in.
- Paste the YAML manifest from the previous step and click `Create`.

You will be redirected to the app configuration page. Your app needs 2 tokens to work.

- **Signing Secret**

    - This is used to verify that the request is coming from Slack. 
    - You can find it under `Basic Information` -> `App Credentials` -> `Signing Secret`. Copy it and save it somewhere safe. 
    - It'd be used as `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` in the next step.

- **Bot User OAuth Token**

    - This is used to authenticate the bot user. 
    - To get a token, you'd first need to install it to your workspace. Go to `Install App` -> `Install to Workspace`. You will be asked to authorize the app. Once you do that, you will be redirected back to the app configuration page. 
    - You can find the token under `OAuth & Permissions` -> `OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace`. Copy it and save it somewhere safe. 
    - It'd be used as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the next step.

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 4: Create required `.env` file

Create a `.env` file with the following content. Replace the values with the ones you got in the previous step. Without these, the bot won't be able to authenticate itself with Slack.

```bash
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-signing-secret>
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token>
OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<your-openai-api-token>
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 5: Create your GDrive service account and download the credentials

To allow the bot to access the pdf files in your GDrive, you need to create a service account and download the credentials. You can read more about it [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#creatinganaccount). Once you have the credentials, save it as `gdrive-service-account.json` in the `examples/hrbot` directory.

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 6: Deploy the app

You can deploy the app using the following command.

```bash
lc-serve deploy jcloud app --env .env
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Step 7: Configure the app to use the deployed URL

1. Go to `Event Subscriptions` -> `Request URL` and set it to the Events URL you got in the previous step. Upon saving, Slack will send a request to the URL to verify it. If everything is configured correctly, you will see a green Verified checkmark. If you see an error instead, check the logs of the deployment on [Jina AI Cloud](https://cloud.jina.ai/user/flows).

2. Go to `Slash Commands` and edit the `/refresh-gdrive-index` command. Set the request URL to the Events URL you got in the previous step.
